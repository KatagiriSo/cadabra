.SH NAME
cadabra \- field\-theory motivated computer algebra system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "cadabra"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cadabra
is a computer algebra system for the manipulation of tensorial expressions.

The output of cadabra is either plain text or UTF8 encoded Unicode
(see the environment variables described below). The line\-breaking
properties of the latter are used to wrap large expressions are
reasonable points. In addition to the standard output, cadabra can
print status information, which is wrapped in special
<status>...</status> blocks.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB \-\-silent\fR
Disables all output, except for output generated by the @print
algorithm.
.TP
\fB \-\-loginput\fR
Copy the input into the log file.
.TP
\fB \-\-input filename\fR
Read the indicated file as input before switching to console input.
.TP
\fB \-\-prompt string\fR
Set the prompt of the interactive session to the indicated string.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following variables toggle various features on or off, depending
on whether the variable is set or not:
.TP 
\fB CDB_PRINTSTAR\fR
Display a star to indicate products. Without this setting, a 
space is used.
.TP
\fB CDB_USE_UTF8\fR
Use UTF8 encoding for output. This in particular will introduce
non\-breakable spaces to group objects together, as well as zero-width
non\-breakable spaces to prevent line\-breaks after brackets, underscore
and caret symbols.  When this variable is not set, the output will be
plain ASCII without any special symbols.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR xcadabra (1).
