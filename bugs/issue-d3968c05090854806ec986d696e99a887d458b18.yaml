title: Fix dependence on numbers
desc: |-
  A declaration of the type a::Depends(0) will introduce dependence on
  all rationals (as the overall constant is always ignored).
  
  Edit: can be circumvented by using a notation with \partial
  which mentions the coordinate name, i.e.
  
     \partial_{x^{0}}{a} + \partial_{x^{1}}{a};
