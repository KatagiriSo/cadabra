title: Redraw segfault on OS X
desc: |-
  When dragging (or resizing?) a window on OS X, the quick successive calls
  to XCadabra::on_configure_event and the subsequent redraw_cells result
  in a segfault somewhere inside convert_subset of the TeX engine. Might
  be because GTK on the mac calls the redraw handler in a different way
  than on X11.
