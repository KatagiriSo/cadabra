title: Single-object factors with brackets do not print correctly
desc: |-
  An expression of the type
  
   \prod(A){B}
  
  does not print correctly (because this is not valid code), yet it gets
  generated by input of the form
  
    (A)*B;
  
  Either automatically strip brackets from single factors or do something
  new with printing; in any case, such expressions will trigger the
  expression checker and should not be left in the tree.
