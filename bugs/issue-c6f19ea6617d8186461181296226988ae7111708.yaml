title: Numerical indices default to position=free.
desc: |-
  Numerical indices default to position=free and hence n^0 equals n_0. 
  Could probably benefit from a declaration of index properties directly
  at the level of the tensor, rather than the indices themselves (though
  this would then require declaration for every tensor, instead of only
  the index set as currently).
