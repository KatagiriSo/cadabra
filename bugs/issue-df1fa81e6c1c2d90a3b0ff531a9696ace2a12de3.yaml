title: Crash with tensors in numerators
desc: |-
  Input of the type
  
   x_i / \sqrt{x_k x_k};
  
  leads to an immediate crash in @reduce_div because the tree looks like
  
    1:{\expression}
    2:  {\prod}
    3:    {x}
    4:      _{i}
    5:    {\frac}
    6:      {\sqrt}
    7:        {\prod}
    8:          {x}
    9:            _{k}
   10:          {x}
   11:            _{k}
