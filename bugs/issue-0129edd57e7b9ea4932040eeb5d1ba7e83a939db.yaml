title: Inherit<...> is not flexible enough
desc: |-
  There is an Inherit<...> template which is only useful if an object
  has a single child, since the other children will simply get ignored.
  Since a multi-child object will almost always need some computation
  to be done in order to compute how the multiple properties of the children
  get converted to a single inherited property, it makes sense to deprecate
  Inherit<...> altogether, in favour of the [...]Base properties.
