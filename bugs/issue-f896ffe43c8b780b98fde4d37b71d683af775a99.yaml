title: "@canonicalise does not honor ImplicitIndex"
desc: |-
  {a,b}::Indices{vector}.
  {a,b}::Integer(0..3).
  \Gamma_{a}::ImplicitIndex.
  \Gamma_{a}\Gamma_{b}-\Gamma_{b}\Gamma_{a};

  @canonicalise!(%);
  @collect_terms!(%);
  
  leads to zero. This is because @canonicalise does not honor ImplicitIndex.
  The logic behind that property is slightly skewed; the TODO file contains
  ideas on how to fix this properly.
