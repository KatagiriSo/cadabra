title: Cleanup of numbers in products contains a fatal bug
desc: |-
  The test
  
  obj4b:= c - a;
  @factor_out!(%){a};
  
  leads to a crash similar to the one reported by Molnar. The algorithm
  creates the tree correctly, but somewhere the cleanup causes problems
  and makes cadabra crash later down the line when extracting properties
  in manipulator.cc.
