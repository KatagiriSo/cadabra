title: Add support for differential 'd'
desc: |-
  While it is possible to use differential 'd' operators by declaring
  them to be Derivatives, this is far from ideal. We need a special
  property for this, so that we can write
  
  d{#}::DifferentialD.
  d{s}**2 = -f(r) d{t}**2 + f(r)**(-1) d{r}**2 + r**2 d{\Omega}**2;
  
  This will only be really useful once the link to a scalar CAS is
  added though.
