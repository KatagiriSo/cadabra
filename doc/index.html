		<div class="section">
		   <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Cadabra is a computer algebra system (CAS) for the manipulation
			of  <em>tensorial
			expressions</em>. It is aimed at, though not necessarily
			restricted to, theoretical high-energy physicists. Because of
			its target audience, the program's interface, storage system
			and underlying philosophy differ substantially from other
			computer algebra systems.  Its main characteristics are:</p>
			<ul>
			<li> Usage of a TeX-like notation, which eliminates many
			  errors in transcribing problems from paper to computer and back.</li>
			<li> Built-in understanding of dummy indices and dummy
			  symbols, including their automatic relabelling when necessary.
			  Powerful algorithms for canonicalisation of objects with index
			  symmetries, both mono-term and multi-term.</li>
			<li> A typing system through properties, but freedom to dispense
			  with this system entirely when it is not needed.</li>
			<li> A new way to deal with products of non-commuting objects,
			  enabling a notation which is identical to standard physicist's
			  notation (i.e.&nbsp;no need for special non-commuting product operators).</li>
			<li> A flexible optional undo system. Interactive calculations
			 can be undone to arbitrary level without requiring a full
			 re-evaluation of the entire calculation.</li>
			<li> A simple and documented way to add new algorithms in
			  the form of C++ modules, which directly operate on the internal
			  expression tree.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cadabra has been under development for some time now, but
         has never left my own computer.  The current version is the
         first public release, intended to collect feedback from a
         wider audience. So, feel free to mail me at
         <tt>kasper.peeters&nbsp;(at)&nbsp;aei.mpg.de</tt> with
         suggestions or constructive criticism.

		   <h2>License and acknowledgements</h2>
			<p>If you use cadabra or even just play with it, I would like
			to hear about it. Please drop me an email so that I can get an
			idea of who is interested in this program.</p>
			<p>Cadabra is available under the conditions of the <a
			href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
			Public License</a>. If you use cadabra in your own work,
			please cite the paper mentioned below (to keep the bean
			counters happy).</p>
         <p>Cadabra contains code taken from Jos&eacute;
 		      Martin-Garcia's <a
 		      href="http://metric.iem.csic.es/Martin-Garcia/xAct/index.html">xPerm</a>
 		      in order to canonicalise tensor expressions. Some of
 		      the algorithms rely on the <a
 		      href="http://young.sp2mi.univ-poitiers.fr/~marc/LiE/">LiE</a>
 		      software by Marc van Leeuwen, Arjeh Cohen and Bert Lisser.</p>

		   <h2>Screenshots</h2>
			<p>Cadabra comes with its own graphical frontend, which is
			based on the gtk toolkit (or rather its C++ wrapper gtkmm) and uses
			LaTeX to typeset expressions. This is a screenshot:</p>
			<p><a href="showcase4.png"><img src="showcase4.png"
			height=400 alt="native gui" /></a></p>
			<p>There is also a <a
			href="http://www.texmacs.org">TeXmacs</a> frontend, displayed
			in the screenshots below. The associated TeXmacs
			files can be found in the "texmacs" subdirectory of the
			source tarball.</p>
			<p><a href="showcase1.png"><img src="showcase1.png"
		height="400" alt="screenshot 1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
		href="showcase3.png"><img src="showcase3.png" height="400"
		alt="screenshot 2"/></a></p>
		</div> 
		<div class="section">
		   <h2>Install a binary</h2>
			<p><strong>(note: there are no binaries or packages
			yet for the new graphical frontend)</strong></p>
			<p>First check below whether there is a package for your
			system, which is always the easiest installation method.</p>
         <p>If you are running Linux (on an Intel processor) or Mac OS&nbsp;X, the
			next simplest way to install cadabra is to install a
			statically linked binary. You need to download two programs,</p>
			<table class="downloads">
         <tr><th>Linux, i386</th><th>Mac OS X, PPC</th></tr>
         <tr><td><a href="prompt.gz">prompt.gz</a></td>
             <td><a href="osx/prompt.gz">prompt.gz</a></td></tr>
			<tr><td><a href="CDBRELEASE.gz">CDBRELEASE.gz</a></td>
			    <td><a href="osx/CDBRELEASE.gz">CDBRELEASE.gz</a></td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>gunzip them both and make them executable with "<tt>chmod
		u+x prompt cadabra</tt>". Put them somewhere in your path. Then
		the command "<tt>prompt cadabra</tt>" should start the program
		(or <tt>./prompt ./cadabra</tt> if the current directory is not
		in your path); if not, email me.</p>
		   <p>If you want to use the <a
		href="http://www.texmacs.org">TeXmacs</a> frontend, you will
		also need the following file:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="init-cadabra.scm">init-cadabra.scm</a></li>
		</ul>
      <p>Store this file in the directory
      <tt>~/.TeXmacs/plugins/cadabra/progs/</tt> and restart TeXmacs.</p>
		<p>Alternatively you can try to locate the <tt>TeXmacs/plugins</tt> directory on your filesystem
		(it is usually something like
		<tt>/usr/share/TeXmacs/plugins</tt>), and make a (nested) subdirectory
		<tt>cadabra/progs</tt> below that. Then copy the
		<tt>init-cadabra.scm</tt> file to this directory and (re)start TeXmacs.</p>
		</div>

		   <h2>Install using Debian, Red Hat, MacPorts, ...</h2>
         <p>Thanks to Greg Wright, cadabra is available for Mac OS X users through <a
			href="http://macports.org">MacPorts</a>.
         Simply type <tt class="cmd">sudo port install cadabra</tt> and all
         required software will be installed automatically. For
			questions about this port, please contact <tt>gwright&nbsp;(at)&nbsp;macports.org</tt>.</p>
         <p>Debian and RPM packages will follow in the near
        future.</p>
      </div>
		<div class="section">
		   <h2>Install from source</h2>
			<p>Installing from source should be no harder than with any
   		other well-behaved GNU tools, i.e.&nbsp;it should be as
   		simple as configure/make/make install. However, you will need
   		to have some additional libraries and tools installed before
   		you can compile cadabra itself. In particular,</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.tcl.tk">tcl8.4</a> with <a
   		href="http://expect.nist.gov/">libexpect</a></li> (on Debian,
   		<tt>apt-get install tcl8.4 expect-dev</tt>)
<!--			<li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/">glib</a></li> -->
         <li><a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/">gmp</a> (configured
   		with <tt>--enable-cxx</tt>)</li> (on Debian, <tt>apt-get
   		install libgmp3-dev libgmpxx3</tt>)
			<li><a href="http://www.pcre.org/">pcre</a> with C++ wrapper enabled (on Debian,
   		<tt>apt-get install libpcre3-dev lib</tt>)
			<li><a
   		href="http://young.sp2mi.univ-poitiers.fr/~marc/LiE/">LiE</a></li>
   		(no Debian package available)
			</ul>
			<p>In order to compile the graphical front-end (add the
			--enable-gui flag to configure) you also need</p>
			<ul>
			<li>gtk+</li>
			<li>gtkmm</li>
			<li>pangomm</li>
			<li>dvipng</li>
			<li>LaTeX</li>
			<li>the breqn package for LaTeX</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cadabra's configure
			script will look for these libraries and programs, and tell
			you when you need to install them. Consult the documentation
			of these programs/libraries for installation
			instructions.</p>
			<p>You then need to compile and install my modglue library,
			which is used to connect the various pieces of cadabra
			together. Download this version here, since it's tuned to cadabra:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="MODGLUERELEASE.tar.gz">MODGLUERELEASE.tar.gz</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This should be a matter of configure/make/make install. 
			Finally, compile and install cadabra itself,</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="CDBRELEASE.tar.gz">CDBRELEASE.tar.gz</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, this should be a matter of configure/make/make
			install. If compilation succeeds, you can also try "make
			test" for some self-tests (which should all pass).</p>
			<p>Since this is the first public release, chances are that
		   some people will encounter problems at one of these
		   steps. Please mail me if you need help.</p>

<!--		<div class="section">
		   <h2>Install a Debian package</h2>
			<p>If you run Debian or a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g.&nbsp;Ubuntu) you
       		can grab the package file and install that directly. You
       		will also need to install the LiE and pcre++ packages
       		(these do not yet exist in the Debian repository) and the
       		modglue package, all available from this site:</p>
			  <ul>
				 <li><a href="lie_2.2.2-1_i386.deb">lie_2.2.2-1_i386.deb</a></li>
				 <li><a href="pcre++_2.2.2-1_i386.deb">pcre++_2.2.2-1_i386.deb</a></li>
				 <li><a href="modglue_1.0-1_i386.deb">modglue_1.0-1_i386.deb</a></li>
				 <li><a href="cadabra_1.0-1_i386.deb">cadabra_1.0-1_i386.deb</a></li>
				 </ul>
			  <p>These packages are a bit of an early experiment, so let me
			  know if you encounter problems.</p>

		   <h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>There are currently two documents about cadabra. One is
			  a paper explaining the motivation for writing this software,
			  as well as sketching the internal structure:</p>
         <blockquote class="reference">
         <div class="author">Kasper Peeters</div>
			<div class="title"><a href="paper.ps.gz">A field-theory
			  motivated approach to symbolic computer algebra</a></div>
			<div class="pubinfo"><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.SC/0608005">cs.SC/0608005</a></div>
         </blockquote>
			<p>The second document is the reference guide and tutorial, 
			available only from here, and still incomplete,</p>
         <blockquote class="reference">
         <div class="author">Kasper Peeters</div>

				 guide and tutorial</a></div>
		   <div class="pubinfo">preprint AEI-2006-038</div>
         </blockquote>
			<p>Finally, if you are interested in the internals of the program, there is some <a
		href="doxygen/html/index.html">doxygen documentation</a>, though
		this is still in a rather preliminary stage.</p>
