\cdbproperty{Depends}{\it comma separated list of indices,
coordinates, derivatives, accents}

Makes an object implicitly dependent on other objects, i.e.~assumes
that the indicated object is a function of the arguments of the
property. For example,
\begin{screen}{1,2}
x::Coordinate.
\phi::Depends(x).
\end{screen}
makes $\phi$ an implicit function of $x$. Instead of indicating the
coordinate on which the object depends, it is also possible to
indicate which derivatives would yield a non-zero answer, as in
\begin{screen}{1,2}
\nabla{#}::Derivative.
\phi::Depends(\nabla).
\end{screen}
Finally, it is possible to use an index name to indicate on which
coordinates a field depends,
\begin{screen}{1,2}
{m,n,p,q}::Indices(vector).
\phi::Depends(m).
\end{screen}

Taking objects out of derivatives (because they do not depend on them)
is handled using the \subscommand{unwrap} algorithm.
