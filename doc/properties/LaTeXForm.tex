\cdbproperty{LaTeXForm}{\sf valid \LaTeX{} expression}

Changes the way in which symbols are displayed in the graphical
interface. Example:
\begin{screen}{1,2}
\del{#}::LaTeXForm("\partial").
\del_{m}(A);
\end{screen}
This prints $\partial_{m}(A);$ in the notebook, despite the fact
that \verb|\del| is not a \LaTeX{} command.

These settings have no effect in the command-line version.
