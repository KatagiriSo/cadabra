\cdbproperty{CommutingAsProduct}{}

This makes an object behave, for purposes of commutation rules, as a
product. 
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
A(#)::CommutingAsProduct.
{Q,X,Y,Z}::AntiCommuting.
A(Y)(Z)(Q)*A(X);
@prodsort!(%);
(-1) A(X) A(Y)(Z)(Q);
\end{screen}
The minus sign arises because it would also have been present when
sorting {\tt (Y*Z*Q)*X}. 
Note that this does not (yet) work when the arguments are given as a
list separated by commas, for instance as {\tt A(Y,Z,Q)}.
