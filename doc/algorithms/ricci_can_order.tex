\cdbalgorithm{ricci\_can\_order}{}

Rewrites all terms with 
two Weyl or Riemann tensors which are doubly contracted in a
canonical form, that is, with the contracted indices sitting on mixed
pairs. The identity that is used is
\begin{equation}
R_{a b m n} R_{c d m n} 
% = 2\, R_{a m n b} R_{c d m n}\, .
% = 2\, R_{a m n b} ( R_{c m n d} + R_{c n d m} )
 = 2\, R_{a m n b} ( R_{c m n d} - R_{d m n c} )\, .
\end{equation}
