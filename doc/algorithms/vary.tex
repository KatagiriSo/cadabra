\cdbalgorithm{vary}{}

Generic variation command.  Takes a rule or a set of rules
according to which the terms in a sum should be varied. In every term,
apply the rule once to every factor.
\begin{screen}{1,2}
A B + A C;
@vary!(%)( A -> \epsilon D,
           B -> \epsilon C,
           C -> \epsilon A - \epsilon B );
\epsilon D B + A \epsilon C + \epsilon D C 
                   + A (\epsilon A - \epsilon B);
\end{screen}
This algorithm is thus mostly intended for variational derivatives
(subsequent partial integrations can be done using \subscommand{pintegrate}).
