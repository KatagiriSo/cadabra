\cdbalgorithm{rewrite\_indices}{}

Rewrite indices on an object by contracting it with a second object
which contains indices of both the old and the new type (a vielbein,
in other words). Example:
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,4}
{m,n,p}::Indices(flat).
{\mu,\nu,\rho}::Indices(curved).
T_{m n p};
@rewrite_indices!(%){ T_{\mu\nu\rho} }{ e_{\mu}^{n} };
T_{\mu \nu \rho} e_{\mu}^{m} e_{\nu}^{n} e_{\rho}^{p};
\end{screen}
However, this also works for other type of index conversions, for
instance if you want to raise or lower an index with a metric,
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
{m,n,p,q,r,s}::Indices(curved, position=fixed).
H_{m n p};
@rewrite_indices!(%){ H^{m n p} }{ g_{m n} };
H^{q r s} g_{m q} g_{n r} g_{p s};
\end{screen}
As this example shows, the desired form of the tensor should be given
as the first argument, and the conversion object (metric, vielbein) as
the second object.
