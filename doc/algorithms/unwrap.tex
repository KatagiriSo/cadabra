\cdbalgorithm{unwrap}{}

Move objects out of \subsprop{Derivative}s or \subsprop{Accent}s when
they do not depend on these operators. Accents will get removed from
objects which do not depend on them, as in the following example:
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,5,6,8}
\hat{#}::Accent.
\hat{#}::Distributable.
B::Depends(\hat).

\hat{A+B+C}:
@distribute!(%);
\hat{A} + \hat{B} + \hat{C};
@unwrap!(%);
A + \hat{B} + C;
\end{screen}
Derivatives will be set to zero if an object inside does not depend on
it,
\begin{screen}{1,2,4,5}
\partial{#}::PartialDerivative.
x::Coordinate.
B::Depends(\partial).

\partial_{x}( A B C ):
@unwrap!(%);
A C \partial_{x}{B};
\end{screen}
Here is another example,
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,4,6}
\del{#}::Derivative.
X::Depends(\del).
\del{X*Y*Z}:
@prodrule!(%);
\del{X} * Y * Z + X * \del{Y} * Z + X * Y * \del{Z};
@unwrap!(%);
\del{X}*Y*Z;
\end{screen}
Note that all objects are by default constants for the action of
\subsprop{Derivative} operators. If you want objects to stay inside
derivative operators you have to explicitly declare that they depend
on the derivative operator or on the coordinate with respect to which
you take a derivative.
