\cdbalgorithm{keep\_weight}{}

Keep only those terms for which a product has the indicated
weight. Weights are computed by making use of the \subsprop{Weight}
property of symbols. This algorithm does the opposite
of \subscommand{drop\_weight}.

As an example, consider the simple case in which we want to keep all
terms with 3~fields. This is done using
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
{A,B}::Weight(label=field).
A B B + A A A + A B + B:
@keep_weight!(%){field}{3};
A B B + A A A 
\end{screen}

However, you can also do more complicated things by assigning non-unit
weights to symbols, as in the example below,
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,4}
{A,B}::Weight(label=field).
C::Weight(label=field, value=2).
A B B + A A A + A B + A C + B:
@keep_weight!(%){field}{3};
A B B + A A A + A C
\end{screen}

Weights can be ``inherited'' by operators by using
the \subsprop{WeightInherit} property. Here is an example using
partial derivatives,
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,4,6}
{\phi,\chi}::Weight(label=small, value=1).
\partial{#}::PartialDerivative.
\partial{#}::WeightInherit(label=all, type=Multiplicative).
\phi \partial_{0}{\phi} + \partial_{0}{\lambda} 
                               + \lambda \partial_{3}{\chi}:
@keep_weight!(%){small}{1};
\lambda \partial_{3}{\chi};
\end{screen}
