A paper introducing Cadabra to high-energy physicists is
available as
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.95\textwidth}
``\emph{Introducing Cadabra: a symbolic computer algebra system for\\
	 field theory problems}'',\\
Kasper Peeters,
preprint SPIN-06/46, ITP-UU-06/56, {\tt hep-th/0701238}.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\medskip

Furthermore, a short paper describing the motivation and key technical
aspects of cadabra is available as
