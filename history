Abandoned ideas:

- Patterns:

       a?VectorIndex     labelled name with property
       a??VectorIndex    labelled object with property
       ?VectorIndex      unlabelled name with property

	    a?  | @@type(a?,VectorIndex)
       a?  | @@regex(a?,"B[0-9]*")

   But for the time being we could do with

         a? | \type{a?}{VectorIndex}

   and catch it just like we catch \regex.
