Generic instructions
----------------------------------

On a Linux machine, or on an OS X machine with all required dependencies
installed (see below), installation is a matter of

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

as usual. If you want it installed in a different directory
than /usr/local, use the --prefix option to configure.


OS-X
----------------------------------

On OS-X you need to install a bunch of other things before you can
compile cadabra. The following has been tested on a clean installation
of Mavericks, and uses Homebrew to get the third-party libraries.

The first steps are easy:

 - install XCode from the Apple store.
 - install Homebrew from http://brew.sh
 - install MacTeX from http://tug.org/mactex/downloading.html

You now have two options. Either you use the Gtk which relies on X11,
or you use a version of Gtk which directly uses the Quartz interface. 

 - X11 version:

     brew install gtk+ pango pangomm gtkmm cairo cairomm
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig

 - Quartz version:

     brew tap acornejo/quartz
     brew install gtk+-quartz pango-quartz pangomm-quartz 
     brew install gtkmm-quartz cairo-quartz cairomm-quartz

After this you should be able to configure and build Cadabra with

     ./configure --disable-runtime-dependency-checks
     make
     sudo make install
