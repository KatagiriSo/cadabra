	other than the first always be treated as patterns, never as
	literal. This would mess up @collect_terms on e.g.

	                 + \commutator{C??}{\commutator{B??}{A??};

	* Made input redirect work in the GUI.

	* Fixed a bug in the GUI which would lead to a hang after kernel
	restart.

	it insert at the current cursor location, rather than the mouse
	location.

2008-06-09  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Added \dot as a reserved keyword for vector dot products; this
	prints as \cdot in the GUI and '.' in the text interface.

	* Added handling of substitution patterns in which patterns have
	child nodes, as in "A?^{\mu} -> A?". This can be used to remove
	contracted indices and write them in dot-product like notation.

2008-06-06  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 0.130.

	* Several documentation updates; now more or less complete.

	* Fixed a long-standing bug which would keep factors of '1' around

2008-02-05  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Fixed a bug in replacement of A(2*B) type constructions which
	would ignore the numerical factor.

2007-12-25  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Removed @remove_weyl_traces and @ricci_identity since their
	functionality has been superseded by @canonicalise and
	@impose_bianchi respectively, which are more powerful.

	* Fixed a bug in the preparser which would cut off input lines
	containing quoted strings with line delimiters.

2007-12-16  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Fixed a bug in @dualise_tensor related to dummy index

	* Added '-S' to the strip command in src/Makefile.in to work
	around a bug in Leopard's strip.

2007-11-25  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Several memory leaks/errors found by valgrind fixed:
	- property information was not erased at @reset.
	- xperm.c contained a memcpy for overlapping segments.
	- xperm.c read usedpoints in schreier_vector without initialising.
	- index_iterator::operator++ used an end_iterator.
	- LiE_t read from uninitialised variable in kgetc().
	- @breakgendelta modified input pointer but did not pass this back.
	- @combine used an iterator to an already erased index.
	- @collect_factors used an iterator after having removed it from fact_hash.

	* Changed 'echo -n' to 'printf' in configure.in so that it runs 
	on Leopard again.

	* Released 0.117 and 0.118, replaced the hep-th paper.

	* Fixed a bug in @decompose which would sometimes crash the

	* Released 0.114.

	* Made cut-n-paste of output cells to input cells work as

	* Fixed a bug in impose_bianchi and updated the routines to use
	index iterators so they work on proper derivative operators too.

2007-03-16  Kasper Peeters  <kasper@pooh>

	* Added handling of selfdual and anti-selfdual tensors to
	@all_contractions. 

	* Fixed a bug in searching of properties which would give
