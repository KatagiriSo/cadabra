This is the public repository of the Cadabra symbolic computer algebra 
software. More information at http://cadabra.phi-sci.com.

Note that this is version 1, for which there will still be bug fixes,
but no new developments. See version 2 (to appear here sometime soon) for 
the interesting stuff...

If you are interested in running this in IPython or Jupyter notebooks,
contact me at cadabra@phi-sci.com; most of the work has already been done.
